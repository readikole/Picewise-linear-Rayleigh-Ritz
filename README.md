# Piecewise Linear Rayleigh-Ritz

The Rayleigh-Ritz method is a method used to approximating boundary value problems --- this method is a variational technique.
Sufficiently differentiable functions which satisfy the boundary conditions are chosen as basis functions, in this case we choose a set of piecewise linear functions to approximate the solution.
